Moja globalâ€™s mission is to support ambitious climate action by developing pioneering, open-source software â€“ including the FLINT software â€“ to help users accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture and other land uses (AFOLU).

## About us

Moja global is a not for profit, collaborative project that brings together a community of experts to develop open-source software that allows users to accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the AFOLU sector. The projectâ€™s members aim to support the widest possible use of credible emissions estimation software.

## What we do?

Moja global is building a community of experts, scientists and developers to create the first open-source source software for MRV systems for the land sector that is affordable, accurate and fully customizable to a userâ€™s needs and available data, whether the user represents a country, a region, a local government, a company or a project.

## Contributing to the ecosystem

The open source community is the heart of moja global and helps us build tools and service to fight climate change. Know more about our ecosystem at [**moja.global**](https://moja.global) and through our projects:

- [FLINT](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT): FLINT is a modular and highly flexible open-source software technology designed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals by the land sector.

- [FLINT-UI](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI): FLINT-UI is a web-based user interface for FLINT for configuring simulations using the FLINT.Cloud APIs and run workflows on browser itself.

- [FLINT.Cloud](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Cloud): FLINT.Cloud is a cloud-based service for FLINT. It allows users to run simulations on the cloud and get results back along with simplifying the installation and configuration of FLINT.

- [GCBM.Chile.Data_Processing](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Chile.Data_Preprocessing): GCBM.Chile.Data_Processing is a repository of pre-processing scripts for the GCBM implementation in Chile.

- [FLINT.Reporting](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Reporting): FLINT.Reporting is a reporting tool for FLINT to classify FLINT output results into standard reporting formats.

- [FLINT.JSON_Interface](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.JSON_Interface): FLINT.JSON_Interface is a JSON-based interface for FLINT to create and edit JSON files in an easy way.

- [FLINT.Example](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Example): FLINT.Example is a repository of example FLINT projects to help start building a project based on the FLINT framework.
