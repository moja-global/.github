moja globalâ€™s mission is to support ambitious climate action by developing open-source software â€“ including the FLINT â€“ to help users accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture and other land uses (AFOLU).

## About us

moja global is a not for profit, collaborative project that brings together a community of experts to develop open-source software that allows users to accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the AFOLU sector. The projectâ€™s members aim to support the widest possible use of credible emissions estimation software.

## What we do?

moja global is building a community of experts, scientists and developers to create the open-source source software for MRV systems for the land sector that is affordable, accurate and fully customizable to a userâ€™s needs and available data, whether the user represents a country, a region, a local government, a company or a climate mitigation project.

## Contributing to the ecosystem

The open source community is the heart of moja global and helps us build tools to fight climate change. Learn more about our ecosystem at [**moja.global**](https://moja.global) and through our projects:

- [FLINT](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT): FLINT is a modular and highly flexible open-source software technology designed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals by the land sector.

- [FLINT-UI](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI): FLINT-UI is a web-based user interface for FLINT for configuring simulations using the FLINT.Cloud APIs and run workflows on browser itself.

- [FLINT.Cloud](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Cloud): FLINT.Cloud is a cloud-based service for FLINT. It allows users to run simulations on the cloud and get results back along with simplifying the installation and configuration of FLINT.

- [FLINT.Example](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Example): FLINT.Example is a repository of example FLINT projects to help start building a project based on the FLINT framework. 

- [GCBM.Chile.Data_Processing](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Chile.Data_Preprocessing): GCBM.Chile.Data_Processing is a repository of pre-processing scripts for the GCBM implementation in Chile.

- [FLINT.Reporting](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Reporting): FLINT.Reporting is a reporting tool for FLINT to classify FLINT output results into standard reporting formats.

- [FLINT.JSON_Interface](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.JSON_Interface): FLINT.JSON_Interface is a JSON-based interface for FLINT to create and edit JSON files in an easy way.
